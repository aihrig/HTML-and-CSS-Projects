      There is little research that is not impacted in some way on or through
      the Internet. The Internet, as a field, a tool, and a venue, has specific
      and far-reaching ethical issues. Internet research ethics is a
      subdiscipline that fits across many disciplines, ranging from social
      sciences, arts and humanities, medical/biomedical, and natural sciences.
      Extant ethical frameworks, including consequentialism, deontology, virtue
      ethics, and feminist ethics, have contributed to the ways in which ethical
      issues in Internet research are considered and evaluated.
